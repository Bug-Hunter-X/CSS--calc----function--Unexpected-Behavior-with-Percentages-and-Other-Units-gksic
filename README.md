# CSS `calc()` Function: Unexpected Behavior with Percentages and Other Units

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function with percentages and other units.  The issue arises from the order of operations and how the browser interprets percentages within the calculation. This can lead to unexpected layout and inconsistencies between browsers.

## The Problem

The `calc()` function allows for dynamic calculations of CSS properties. However, when combining percentages with fixed units (like pixels or ems), the order of evaluation can be tricky, often leading to inaccurate results.  Percentages are relative to the containing element's size, but if that size isn't yet determined when the `calc()` function is executed, the results can be incorrect.

## Solution

The solution usually involves restructuring your CSS to avoid mixing percentages with fixed units within a `calc()` function or making calculations based on pre-defined units or variables to avoid circular dependencies. Alternatively, use JavaScript to calculate dimensions based on element dimensions and then apply styles accordingly. 

This repository includes examples illustrating the problem and proposed solutions.
